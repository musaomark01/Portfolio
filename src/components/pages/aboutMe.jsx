                Hello, my name is <strong>Musa Omar</strong> and I am a <strong>Full Stack Web Developer</strong>.
                I have a passion for coding and love to create new experiences for users. I am a graduate of the 
                Michigan State University Coding Bootcamp and have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, 
                Express.js, React.js, MySQL, MongoDB, and more. I am a quick learner and am always looking to expand 
                my knowledge and skill set. I am thrilled about the future possibilities in technology and look 
                forward to contributing my skills to create meaningful solutions that enhance the way users interact 
                with the web.
